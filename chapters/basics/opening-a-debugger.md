### Opening Debuggers

There are many ways to open debuggers.
For example, executing `1/0` will raise a `ZeroDivide` exception.
In the normal case, such exceptions automatically trigger the opening of a debugger.
The other way of opening debuggers is to select a piece of code and to debug it.
This can be done through a right click and then selecting *Debug it* from the contextual menu, or by using the debug shortcut (_ctrl+shift+d_ on windows/linux or _cmd+shift+d_ on mac).


You can open any number of debuggers at the same time.
For example, you can debug two programs side by side, or leave a debugger open while doing other activities --- such as debugging another piece of code.

Once you are in a debugger, you can observe and control your execution.
